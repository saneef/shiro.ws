# Source code for shiro.ws

The project is using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) and [WebC](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/).
We use Notion (database) as the CMS.
The website is hosted on Netlify.
We call Netlify's build hook from iOS or macOS shortcut app to rebuild and depoly the website.
